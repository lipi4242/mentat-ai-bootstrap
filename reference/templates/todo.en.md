# Todo Template (EN)

A single concrete task with a doable shape.

## When to create one

Any concrete task with a doable shape — verb + object, can be marked done.
If a task has more than ~5 sub-steps or spans multiple sessions, consider a
`specification` instead.

## Frontmatter

```yaml
---
type: todo
status: open   # open | in-progress | done | cancelled
priority: med  # low | med | high
due: YYYY-MM-DD   # optional
tags: [...]
---
```

## Body structure

1. **Task** — one line, verb-first (e.g. "Draft invoice for April").
2. **Context** — why this matters and where it came from (1–3 sentences or link).
3. **Definition of done** — 1–3 bullets stating exactly when this can be marked done.

## Filename

`agy/todos/<slug>.md`
